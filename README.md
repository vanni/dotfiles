This is my dotfiles config repo to quickly restore all my configuration on a new build
Just clone it to the home dir, install the apps and wm that you require then run the STOW command to restore all or the config files you wish.
THere are directories with my dotfiles for different applications and one called tips with some documentation useful to rebuild my machine.
